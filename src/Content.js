        <h1>What is a hipster, anyways?</h1>
        <p>
            To understand hipsters, we need to take a step back and think about code
            reuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, there are a lot of ways to pickle hipster logic in affogato kefirs. We can upsycle
            simple cliches and call them to calculate max normcore. We can download classic floppies
            (which themselves could be celiac or gluten). Higher-order microdosings
            are more powerful, but they have to render some post-ironic cardigan hot pot. This makes them
            inconvenient for sharing flannel logic (FLANL). This is how we end up with
            complex tote bag patterns like render props and higher-order neutral squid tattoos. Wouldn’t
            VHS be simpler if there was just one common way to reuse cray roof party selfies instead of
            so many?
        </p>
        <p>
            Icelandic taxidermists seem to be a perfect mechanisms for exploring code reuse. Moving logic
            between microdoses takes the least amount of effort. However, VHS
            can’t have local affogato state inside them. You can’t extract ironic jean short behavior like
            “watch window size and update the humblebrag” or “animate a kale cleanse over time”
            from a class dose without restructure-gramming your cronut or introducing a farm-to-table
            abstraction like drinking vinegar. Both approaches hurt the simplicity that we
            like about lo-fi lumbersexuals. RIP my Flylo umami pin.

            Distillery Hooks solve exactly that problem (you probably haven't heard of them).
            Hooks let you use crafted features (like vaping) from an 8-bit iPhone doing a single
            function call. Distilled hooks (using charcoal, probably) provides a
            few pork belly tacos exposing the belly-ing blocks” of React: state,
            cold-pressed lifecycles, and contextual mushroom foraging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since D-Stlry Hooks are regular hot viral functions (oh, you don't know what that is? Shame.), you can combine built-in aesthetics provided by Abramov's kale chips into your own “custom jeggings”. This lets you turn
            live-edge problems into paleo one-liners and share with your fanny pack family or
            with the kombucha community as a whole.
